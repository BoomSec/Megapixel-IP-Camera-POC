# CameraSnaps Folder

This folder is intended to retain a photographic copy of the results obtained upon completion of the request for documentation purposes.

## Purpose
The images stored in this folder are snapshots captured during the execution of a script or application. They serve as a visual record of the outcomes, providing a documentation reference for analysis or review.

## Usage
- The images in this folder correspond to specific results or states achieved during the script execution.
- Each image is named in a way that links it to the corresponding result or context.
- Feel free to refer to these images for documentation or analysis purposes.

## File Naming Convention
The images are named with a unique identifier that typically includes an IP address and port number, where the standard colon (`:`) is replaced with a non-standard character. For example:

- `69.69.69.69ï€º420_image.jpg`

Please note that the actual file name may use a special character in place of the standard colon due to file system limitations or encoding considerations. This naming convention helps associate each image with a specific result or context based on the IP address (69.69.69.69) and port (420) used during the script execution.

## Additional Information
For more details about the script or application generating these images, refer to the main documentation or README file located in the parent directory.

Feel free to contact the project maintainers for any inquiries or assistance.

Thank you!
